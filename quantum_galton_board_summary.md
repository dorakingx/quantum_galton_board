# Quantum Galton Board Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of implementing quantum Galton boards based on the "Universal Statistical Simulator" paper by Mark Carney and Ben Varcoe. The implementation demonstrates how quantum circuits can simulate classical statistical distributions, specifically the binomial distribution that emerges from the classical Galton board experiment.

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Classical Galton Board
The classical Galton board consists of a series of pegs arranged in rows. A ball dropped from the top has a 50/50 chance of going left or right at each peg. After passing through all levels, the ball's final position follows a binomial distribution, which converges to a Gaussian distribution as the number of levels increases (Central Limit Theorem).

### 1.2 Quantum Implementation
The quantum version uses qubits to represent each level of the Galton board:
- Each qubit represents one level of pegs
- Hadamard gates create superposition states (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
- Measurement collapses the superposition to classical outcomes
- The number of 1s in the measurement result represents the final position

### 1.3 Mathematical Framework
For n levels with bias p:
- **Binomial Distribution**: P(X=k) = C(n,k) × p^k × (1-p)^(n-k)
- **Mean**: μ = np
- **Variance**: σ² = np(1-p)
- **Gaussian Approximation**: N(μ, σ²) for large n
